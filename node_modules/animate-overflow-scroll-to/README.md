# animate-overflow-scroll-to

Smooth element scroll to position with `requestAnimationFrame` and [Tween](https://github.com/component/tween).

## Fork notice

This is a fork of [scroll-to](https://github.com/component/scroll-to) 

This fork does the following:
 
 - expands the API by enabling animated / smooth scrolling for any element that has the `scrollTop` / `scrollLeft` properties along with the CSS style `overflow: scroll` enabled.
 - adds server side rendering support via [@hampusohlsson](https://github.com/component/scroll-to/pull/10/commits/675a1ade2d747f734ebcf12f2c43dc166b3dc692)

## Installation

`npm i animate-overflow-scroll-to`

## API

### scrollTo(domNode, x, y, [options])

  Scroll a `domNode` to the given point `x, y` with the given `options`:

  - `ease` easing function defaulting to "out-circ" (view [ease](https://github.com/component/ease) for more)
  - `duration` animation duration defaulting to `1000`

```js
var scrollTo = require('animate-overflow-scroll-to');

// scrollDiv should have overflow: scroll set in its style
var scrollDiv = document.getElementById('scrollDiv')

scrollTo(scrollDiv, 500, 1200, {
  ease: 'out-bounce',
  duration: 1500
});
```

## Example

You should be able to run the `example.html` file to try it out.

## Building

Building should not be necessary to use it as a module.

If for whatever reason, you need to build the file (eg forking this project and updating the `example.html`), you need to install `component` to build the bundle.

`component` is outdated, but PRs are welcomed to switch the build to something else like `browserify` or `webpack`.

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm install -g component
$ component build
```
